# Exercise: Other operators
Define a testing class where you:
* define an int variable called `a` and initialise it with the value `15`
* add `5` to `a` without repeating the `a` variable (e.g. `a = a + 5` is not accepted)
* then subtract `4` to `a` without repeating the `a` variable
* assign the value of `a` to `int b` and increment `b` by one without using `a` or `int b = b + 1`
* check and prints if both the following statements are `true`:
  * statement 1: check if `b` is an odd number
  * statement 2: check if the result of (`b` multiplied for `b + 1`) is a multiple of `3`
